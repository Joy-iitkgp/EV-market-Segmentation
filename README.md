# EV-market-Segmentation
Electric vehicle (EV) market segmentation is an important topic because
it helps understand the diverse needs and preferences of potential EV buyers. 
By segmenting the market based on factors like price range, Top speed, vehicle type, and fast charging,
manufacturers and policymakers can develop tailored strategies to meet specific customer demands and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles on a broader scale.
Effective market segmentation can also drive innovation and competition, leading to a more sustainable and consumer-centric EV market.
